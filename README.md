# Handwritten Digit Calculator using Knowledge Distillation (KD)
A deep learning project using Knowledge Distillation on a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can recognise handwritten mathematical symbols. The model has been used in an calculator able to calculate the value of handwritten mathematical expressions

This project has been developed using the [Basic Handwritten Math Symbols Dataset](https://github.com/wblachowski/bhmsds?fbclid=IwAR2WbJRLMxecP4a41iTjJR-_idug6anFvjFdz8XyinaZV7gA8OFwaah7MR8).


Included in this repository:
- Two ipynb files: One only containing the CNN model without KD (project.ipynb) and one implementing the KD network (project_optimized.ipynb) 
- Test images for the calculator 
- Pretrained models of the teacher, student and KD student
